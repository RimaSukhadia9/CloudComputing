First of all there are files for each of three benchmarks namely CPU.java, Disk.java and Network.java.
Now open the command prompt in the run for the console and then set the path of these file locations and invoke the file using:
Javac “filename”.java 

command to compile the file named as “filename” which can be either CPU, Disk or Network in here.
This will compile the .java file and thus will allow you to run the source JAVA file using:
java “filename” 


command which will execute the output of the program as per the code mentioned in .java source code file.
